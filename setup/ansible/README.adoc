Ansible Playbook designed to perform the steps in ../rhel8.txt. 
Includes a Vagrantfile configured to test the playbook with a
CentOS 8 box.

Runs cleanly against the Vagrantfile for CentOS 8, but the results
have not been tested and a RHEL 8 test has not yet been performed.

Licensed under Apache 2.0 to ensure it can be distributed/edited.
